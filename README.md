# libheap
here is an implementation of a general min/max heap library, including heap and indexHeap, which supports deletion, heapification, key query and key changing operations.  
Indexheap is a significant heap structure which stores and sorts (index,key) pairs according to their key, it is essential in efficient implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorthm and other variants.
